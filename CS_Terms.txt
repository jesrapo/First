Binary Tree|A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children. Typically the child nodes are called a "left" pointer, a "right" pointer. The "root" pointer points to the topmost node in the tree. The left and right pointers recursively point to smaller "subtrees" on either side. One common use of binary trees is binary search trees; another is binary heaps.|Labautopedia|http://www.labautopedia.org/mw/List_of_programming_and_computer_science_terms
Class|Class, in the context of object oriented computer language, is the prototype for an object in an object-oriented language; analogous to a derived type in a procedural language. A class may also be considered to be a set of objects which share a common structure and behaviour. The structure of a class is determined by the class variables which represent the state of an object of that class and the behaviour is given by a set of methods associated with the class.|Labautopedia|http://www.labautopedia.org/mw/List_of_programming_and_computer_science_terms
Compiler|Compiler is a type of computer program that translates source code into object code. A compiler is likely to perform many or all of the following operations: lexing, preprocessing, parsing, semantic analysis, code optimizations, and code generation.|Labautopedia|http://www.labautopedia.org/mw/List_of_programming_and_computer_science_terms

Abstract Base Class|An abstract base class, a term used in the object oriented programming language, is meant to be used as the base class from which other classes are derived|labautopedia|http://www.labautopedia.org/mw/List_of_programming_and_computer_science_terms
Boolean Algebra|Boolean algebra is an algebraic structure (a collection of elements and operations on them obeying defining axioms) that captures essential properties of both set operations and logic operations. Specifically, it deals with the set operations of intersection, union, complement; and the logic operations of AND, OR, NOT. A Boolean algebra is also called a Boolean lattice.|labautopedia|http://www.labautopedia.org/mw/List_of_programming_and_computer_science_terms
